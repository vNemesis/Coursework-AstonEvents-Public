## Notes, License & Copyright
*A Functionally Equivalent Statement is a code fragment which, regardless of whitespace and object names, achieves the same result within the context of a PHP web application. Basically you can't copy the code, rename the variables, add whitespace and say it's different. It's not, Durr.

Bottom Line, Have a looksy and see if you see something I can improve, tell me, Submit a Pull Request, but please don't steal as time and effot has gone into this project and since its educational using it for educational work is techinally plagiarism.
